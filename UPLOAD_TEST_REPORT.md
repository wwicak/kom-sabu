- `src/app/api/analytics/breadcrumb/insights/route.ts`

### 2. FormData Parsing Issues ❌→✅
**Problem**: Node.js FormData not compatible with Next.js request.formData()
**Solution**: Created test endpoint and used curl for proper testing

### 3. Image Processing Validation ❌→✅
**Problem**: Corrupted test images failing Sharp processing
**Solution**: Used real JPEG images from external sources for testing
